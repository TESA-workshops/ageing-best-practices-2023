Dear Dr. Clements,
We are happy to share with you a revised version of our report "Proceedings of the Technical Expertise in Stock Assessment (TESA) national workshop on 'Best practices in age estimation', 31 January to 02 February 2023 in Moncton, New Brunswick" and believe that the document is now ready for publication as a Canadian Technical Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences.

We addressed all the reviewers' comments that were received on January 22 2024, and our detailed responses to reviewers' comments is attached as a separate Word document.

We look forward to hearing from you about this resubmission of our report. If you share our belief that the report is ready for publication, please inform us once a report number and ISBN have been issued by the DFO Library, the document will be rendered again to include them in the PDF to be published.

Thanks again for your assistance with getting this work published.
