    abstract = "{Yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) (Storer, 1839) on the Grand Bank off Newfoundland were traditionally aged using surface-read whole otoliths. Age determination of otoliths from recaptures of fish tagged in the early 1990s indicated that the traditional ageing technique was underestimating the ages of yellowtail flounder when compared with the time at liberty. Age comparisons between whole and thin-sectioned otoliths showed agreement in age readings up to 7 years; thereafter whole otoliths tended to give much lower ages than those estimated by thin sections. Length–frequency analysis of pelagic and demersal juveniles, captive rearing of juveniles and marginal increment analysis all corroborated age determination based on thin sections. Tag-recaptures and bomb radiocarbon assays validated age interpretations based on thin sections in young and old yellowtail flounder, respectively. Ages were validated up to 25 years for females and 21 years for males. However, because of increased narrowing of annuli in thin-sectioned otoliths from old fish, even thin sections may underestimate the true age of the fish. von Bertalanffy growth curve parameters (combined sexes) were L∞ = 55.6 cm total length, K=0.16 and t0=−0.003. These results challenge the conventional view that yellowtail flounder on the Grand Banks are a relatively fast growing, short-lived species.}",

abstract = {Information on fish age constitutes one of the most important biological variables for a fish stock, and an accurate estimation of the age structure of the fish populations is essential for the reliable management of these natural resources. The age of individual cod (Gadus morhua) is determined by manually examining the layered structure of otoliths, a calcium carbonate structure of the inner ear. Image-based methods to age otoliths have been investigated for over 4 decades with varying results, but recent developments in automatic image analysis techniques are promising. The objective of this paper is to describe a method to efficiently image a manually broken otolith (avoiding the time-consuming embedding and cross-sectioning process) and to describe the organization and acquisition of imaged broken otolith images with associated metadata for a collection of north-east Arctic cod otoliths. A single-lens reflex camera was used for capturing photographs of the broken otoliths. A total of six images were acquired for each subject, consisting of three images in the first position with three different light exposures and three images in the second position with three different light exposures. This results in a simple and efficient procedure for capturing clear, satisfactory, and reproducible images of broken fish otoliths, and a more straightforward and less labour-intensive alternative to the commonly used methods that involve embedding and cross-sectioning of the otolith.},

    abstract = {The age structure of a fish population has important implications for recruitment processes and population fluctuations, and is a key input to fisheries-assessment models. The current method of determining age structure relies on manually reading age from otoliths, and the process is labor intensive and dependent on specialist expertise. Recent advances in machine learning have provided methods that have been remarkably successful in a variety of settings, with potential to automate analysis that previously required manual curation. Machine learning models have previously been successfully applied to object recognition and similar image analysis tasks. Here we investigate whether deep learning models can also be used for estimating the age of otoliths from images. We adapt a pre-trained convolutional neural network designed for object recognition, to estimate the age of fish from otolith images. The model is trained and validated on a large collection of images of Greenland halibut otoliths. We show that the model works well, and that its precision is comparable to documented precision obtained by human experts. Automating this analysis may help to improve consistency, lower cost, and increase the extent of age estimation. Given that adequate data are available, this method could also be used to estimate age of other species using images of otoliths or fish scales.},

abstract = { Otolith microstructure examination has found an increasing number of applications in recent years. However, few workers have critically assessed the assumptions upon which the age and growth inferences are based or considered the potential for environmental modification of microstructural features. This paper reviews present applications and their assumptions and suggests future directions. Particular attention is given to the premises that the frequency of increment formation is constant and that the width of increments is proportional to fish growth. A hypothesis of increment formation is presented which appears consistent with the numerous and often conflicting studies reported to date. The presence of an endogenous circadian rhythm of increment formation is invoked, entrained by photoperiod, but susceptible to modification by other cyclic environmental variables. Increments formed as a result of the circadian rhythm (once per 24 h) may be induced by different processes than those induced through the action of environmental cues (often > 1 per 24 h), thus explaining apparent morphological differences in increment structure noted by some workers. Temperature fluctuations appear to be a primary source of subdaily increments and are a potential source of error in otolith interpretation.}

abstract = { The chronological properties of otoliths are unparalleled in the animal world, allowing accurate estimates of age and growth at both the daily and the yearly scale. Based on the successes of calcified structures as environmental proxies in other taxa, it was logical that researchers should attempt to link otolith biochronologies with otolith chemistry. With the benefit of hindsight, this anticipation may have been naive. For instance, the concentrations of many elements are lower in the otolith than in corals, bivalves, seal teeth, or the other bony structures of fish, making them less than ideal for elemental analyses. Nevertheless, there is growing interest in the use of otolith chemistry as a natural tag of fish stocks. Such applications are directed at questions concerning fish populations rather than using the fish as a passive recorder of the ambient environment and do not rely upon any explicit relationship between environmental variables and otolith chemistry. The questions that can be addressed with otolith chemistry are not necessarily answerable with genetic studies, suggesting that genetic and otolith studies complement rather than compete with each other. Thus, we believe that otolith applications have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the integrity of fish populations and the management of fish stocks.}

abstract = { Response-selective stratified sampling (RSSS) has been well studied in the statistical literature; however, the application of the resulting statistical theories and methods to a specific case of RSSS in fisheries studies, namely length-stratified age sampling (LSAS), is inadequate. We review nine estimation approaches for RSSS found in the statistical and fisheries science literature in terms of three sampling components: the first phase length composition sample, the second phase age composition sample, and the sampling scheme. We compare the performance in terms of RRMSE (relative root mean squared error) for von Bertalanffy (vonB) growth model parameter estimation using an extensive simulation study. We further demonstrate methods by applying the two best-performing and the most popular methods to estimate the vonB model parameters for American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) in NAFO Divisions 3LNO. Our simulations demonstrated that mis-specifying one or more of the three sampling components increases the RRMSEs, and this effect is magnified when the age distribution is incorrectly specified. The optimal approach for data based on LSAS is the empirical proportion approach, and we recommend this method for growth parameter estimation based on LSAS data. }

Size selection changed from favouring fast growth in the 1970s to favouring slow growth in the late 1980s and 1990s. There was an intervening period of disruptive selection where fast and slow growth was favoured while intermediate growth rates were selected against. The intensity of size selection declined at the end of the study period following the closure of the commercial fishery. These different forms of selection (positive directional, negative directional, and disruptive selection) can all be accounted for by the sharply dome-shaped curve of fishing mortality against length observed in the fishery. }

abstract = { Many collapsed fish populations have failed to recover after a decade or more with little fishing. This may reflect evolutionary change in response to the highly selective mortality imposed by fisheries. Recent experimental work has demonstrated a rapid genetic change in growth rate in response to size-selective harvesting of laboratory fish populations. Here, we use a 30-year time-series of back-calculated lengths-at-age to test for a genetic response to size-selective mortality in the wild in a heavily exploited population of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Controlling for the effects of density- and temperature-dependent growth, the change in mean length of 4-year-old cod between offspring and their parental cohorts was positively correlated with the estimated selection differential experienced by the parental cohorts between this age and spawning. This result supports the hypothesis that there have been genetic changes in growth in this population in response to size-selective fishing. Such changes may account for the continued small size-at-age in this population despite good conditions for growth and little fishing for over a decade. This study highlights the need for management regimes that take into account the evolutionary consequences of fishing. }
