# Workshop activities and presentations

A number of presentations were given during the workshop (Table \ref{tab:talks}).

As part of the workshop planning, participants were asked to provide a summary of physical collections of age structures and to identify the programs that were involved in the collection and analysis of ages using these structures. Given the large number of taxa for which ageing materials are collected by different regions of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (Figure \@ref(fig:fighistogram)), the recommendations from this workshop involve programs spanning the whole country, and concern stocks in the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans, as well as a number of diadromous and freshwater species.

## Day 1 - Basics of age estimation {#sec:day1}

The first day covered the basics of ageing. The literature on research associated with otoliths is vast and varied. Peter Comeau gave a presentation on the history and realities of age estimation of marine organisms. His presentation highlighted the importance of age estimation in stock assessments. He also pointed out that there once was a stigma associated with jobs that involved age estimation, they were perceived as an entry-level position with a low retention rate, whereas the reality is that they require a unique skill set, considerable experience and are essential to scientific inquiries related to fish population dynamics.

Julie Coad Davies gave an overview of the age estimation activities that she is involved in, in her role as lab manager for DTU Aqua and also through her chairing the ICES Working Group on SmartDots Governance ([WGSMART](https://www.ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/WGSMART.aspx)) and the ICES Working Group on Biological Parameters ([WGBIOP](https://www.ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/WGBIOP.aspx)). Julie highlighted the importance of clear communication between laboratories and the paramount role of exchanges of both physical otoliths and digital images to identify potential age estimation biases that may exist between laboratories. Similarly, the ICES working groups have in their mandate the formulation of shared methodologies and protocols and provide guidelines for how to best captures information on biological parameters and how to conduct otolith exchanges between laboratories [@ICES:BIOP].

Stephen Wischniowski shared his experience of running an age estimation laboratory (the [Sclerochronology Lab](https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/species-especes/agelab-scalimetrie/index-eng.html) at the Pacific Biological Station) and being involved in the Committee of Age Reading Experts ([CARE](https://care.psmfc.org/)). The demands for age estimation services from the lab far exceed its ability to process samples and a "quota" is imposed on the number of otoliths that the lab can process. The lab technicians are taught the intricacies associated with age estimation from all types of species and structures. Stephen estimates that it takes five years to train a technician to the point where they can reliably estimate ages and can teach others.

Sylvie Robichaud and Karen Robertson presented the procedures associated with age estimation of Atlantic Herring in the Gulf Region. There are two spawning components that must first be distinguished from each other before age estimates can be made. The morphology of otoliths is used to distinguish between spawning components and the number of annuli and the date of capture are then integrated into an age estimate. The otoliths come from a variety of sources, ranging from research surveys to experimental fishing and from commercial fisheries. The laboratory protocols used to process samples require the extraction of otoliths, which are subsequently mounted in epoxy resin, photographed, and are then used for age estimation. 

Kim Emond and Hélène Dionne presented the procedures associated with age estimation of Atlantic Herring in the Québec Region.The otolith based techniques to decipher between spring spawning and fall spawning herring stocks of Atlantic Herring used by the Quebec region were explained and shown. Similarities were seen between approaches used by the technicians in the Gulf region and those in the Quebec region both for ageing Herring and spawning component assignment. The stock assessment for this stock relies on a variety of data sources and on a comprehensive sampling of otoliths. Ages determined from otolith's are essential to the stock assessment as they are a precursor for many important population model inputs such as the catch-at-age. 

Tania Davignon-Burton gave a talk of reconciling expectations and realities in a production ageing environment. There are often high expectations for estimating ages using otoliths, but the laboratory activities required to obtain age estimates mean that some prioritization must take place.In essence, it is not always quick and easy to age otoliths, it takes time and often demand outweighs technichian time.

During the question period there was discussions pertaining to the importance of cleaning and storing ageing structures appropriately. It was highlighted that clean otoliths are required for taking high quality pictures that are optimal for ageing. Previously some labs had stored otoliths in glycerin solutions, however there was a consensus that it is better to store otoliths dry, this is better for otolith preservation, reading of older otoliths, otolith microchemistry and isotopes. Several participants agreed its best to clean otoliths immediately upon extractio, dry appropriately, and store dry, this is best for ageing, microchemistry and isotopes. If otoliths are read with the help of solutions such as glycerin, after reading otoliths should be cleaned, dried and stored dry. 

Tracey Loewen and Rick Wastle presented their work on estimating ages of difficult-to-age species and otolith microchemistry techniques used for ageing. They explained that their Otolith Ageing Lab at the Freshwater Institute in Winnipeg is responsible for ageing 32 species found in the Arctic, including but not limited to Arctic Charr, Dolly Varden Charr, Lake Trout, Greenland Halibut, Redfish and Arctic Cod. Otolih microchemistry techniques are used to support and validate age estimation technique, such as annualr Zinc markers that align with growth rings on otoliths. Rick Wastle went in depth on approaches used to age Greenland Halibut in the Arctic as this species is difficult to age because of its slow growth. Despite the difficulty with ageing the species, the lab persisted, testing a wide range of approaches before settling on what is perceived as the best and  appropriate ageing methods and these methods that they developed improve the understanding of growth for the species. They elaborated that Strontium Calcium (SrCl) marking was used to try and validate growth rings with moderate success, and concluded sectioning the left otolith bulge as well as longitudinal sectioning have advantages for ageing this difficult-to-age, slow growing species. 

Daniel Ricard presented the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) document used in the Gulf Region. This document is meant as a central point for any person seeking information about age estimation in the Gulf Region. The SOP document contains detailed information the collection, preparation, ageing and storage of age structures for fish species that are aged in the Gulf region. The summary of otolith collections held by the Gulf Region and available as OpenData records was also presented and suggested as a starting point for documenting physical collections, including reference collections.
