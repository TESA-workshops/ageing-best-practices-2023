# Workshop activities and presentations

A number of presentations were given during the workshop (Table \ref{tab:talks}).

As part of the workshop planning, participants were asked to provide a summary of physical collections of age structures and to identify the programs that were involved in the collection and analysis of ages using these structures. Given the large number of taxa for which ageing materials are collected by different regions of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (Figure \@ref(fig:fighistogram)), the recommendations from this workshop involve programs spanning the whole country, and concern stocks in the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans, as well as a number of diadromous and freshwater species.

## Day 1 - Basics of age estimation {#sec:day1}

The first day covered the basics of ageing. The literature on research associated with otoliths is vast and varied. Peter Comeau gave a presentation on the history and realities of age estimation of marine organisms. His presentation highlighted the importance of age estimation in stock assessments. He also pointed out that there once was a stigma associated with jobs that involved age estimation, they were perceived as an entry-level position with a low retention rate, whereas the reality is that they require a unique skill set, considerable experience and are essential to scientific inquiries related to fish population dynamics.

Julie Coad Davies gave an overview of the age estimation activities that she is involved in, in her role as lab manager for DTU Aqua and also through her chairing the ICES Working Group on SmartDots Governance ([WGSMART](https://www.ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/WGSMART.aspx)) and the ICES Working Group on Biological Parameters ([WGBIOP](https://www.ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/WGBIOP.aspx)). Julie highlighted the importance of clear communication between laboratories and the paramount role of exchanges of both physical otoliths and digital images to identify potential age estimation biases that may exist between laboratories. Similarly, the ICES working groups have in their mandate the formulation of shared methodologies and protocols and provide guidelines for how to best captures information on biological parameters and how to conduct otolith exchanges between laboratories [@ICES:BIOP].

Stephen Wischniowski shared his experience of running an age estimation laboratory (the [Sclerochronology Lab](https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/species-especes/agelab-scalimetrie/index-eng.html) at the Pacific Biological Station) and being involved in the Committee of Age Reading Experts ([CARE](https://care.psmfc.org/)). The demands for age estimation services from the lab far exceed its ability to process samples and a "quota" is imposed on the number of otoliths that the lab can process. The lab technicians are taught the intricacies associated with age estimation from all types of species and structures. Stephen estimates that it takes five years to train a technician to the point where they can reliably estimate ages and can teach others.

Sylvie Robichaud and Karen Robertson presented the procedures associated with age estimation of Atlantic Herring in the Gulf Region. There are two spawning components that must first be distinguished from each other before age estinates can be made. The morphology of otoliths is used to distinguish between spawning components and the number of annuli and the date of capture are then integrated into an age estimate. The otoliths come from a variety of sources, ranging from reasearch surveys to experimental fishing and from commercial fisheries. The laboratory protocols used to process samples require the extraction of otoliths, which are subsequently mounted in epoxy resin, photographed, and are then used for age estimation. 

Kim Emond and Hélène Dionne presented the procedures associated with age estimation of Atlantic Herring in the Québec Region. The stock assessment for this stock relies on a variety of data sources and on a comprehensive sampling of otoliths.

Tania Davignon-Burton gave a talk of reconciling expectations and realities in a production ageing environment. There are often high expectations for estimating ages using otoliths, but the laboratory activities required to obtain age estimates mean that some prioritization must take place. 

Tracey Loewen and Rick Wastle presented their work on estimating ages of Greenland Halibut in the Arctic. This species is difficult to age because of its slow growth but the methods that they developed improve the understanding of growth.

Daniel Ricard presented the Standard Operating Procedures document used in the Gulf Region. This document is meant as a central point for any person seeking information about age estimation in the Gulf Region. The summary of otolith collections held by the Gulf Region and available as OpenData records was also presented and suggested as a starting point for documenting physical collections, including reference collections.
