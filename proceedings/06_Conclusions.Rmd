# Recommendations {#sec:recommendations}
The working group formulated the following recommendations for how to deal with physical collections of structures used for age estimation.

## Institutional
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Foster a community of DFO scientists whose mandated tasks include sampling of ageing structures, age estimation using ageing structures or analysis of age estimates data}
\item{Emulate the Pacific Ocean’s Community of Age Reading Experts (CARE) for the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans}
\item{Creation of a DFO working group that meets regularly to ensure that age estimations practices in different labs follow shared best practices}
\item{Provide support for inter-regional ageing structure exchanges and secondary reader testing}
\item{Achieve Canadian representation on appropriate ICES working groups related to age estimation (WGBIOP or WGSMART)}
\item{Recognise the fact that the skills required to obtain unbiased age estimates from ageing structures are unique and take time and dedication to acquire}
\end{enumerate}


## Ageing structure cataloguing, storage and inventory

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Ensure that physical collections of ageing structures follow the DFO "Policy on Collection, Storage, Management and Use of Physical Samples for Science Research"}
\item{Ageing structures should be stored in an environment that minimizes degradation and that maintains readability}
\item{Ageing structures removed from an individual should be uniquely identified}
\item{Clearly label ageing structures so they can be traced back to their collection, implement good bookkeeping of your ageing structures}
\item{An electronic inventory of the physical ageing structures available should be documented and updated regularly}
\item{A subset of ageing structures should be preserved in their unaltered state for future unforeseen usage (i.e. not in resin)}
\end{enumerate}

## Reference collection

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Actively curate reference collections so that old ageing structures that have lost their readability are replaced by new ageing structures, this includes renewing ageing structures}
\item{Strive to have a validation study to ascertain the periodicity of ageing patterns}
\item{Ensure that the age structures in the reference collection are representative of what will be available to age estimation technicians (the structures should cover wide spatial and temporal ranges, ...)}
\item{In addition to a physical reference collection, develop its digital equivalent by taking images of the ageing structures}
\item{Ideally, also annotate your digital reference collection using SmartDots}
\end{enumerate}

## Laboratory operations

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Strive to obtain unbiased age estimates}
\item{Develop and publish Standard Operating Procedures for each lab}
\item{Develop standardized protocols to validate age estimates (add to your regional SOP)}
\item{Favour age estimation in a “blind” setting, where no prior knowledge is used when interpreting patterns in ageing structures, don’t let outside information influence your age estimates}
\item{Establish a quality-control process to identify mistakes made during data entry (e.g. a typo)}
\item{Document the uncertainty associated with age estimates}
\item{Have at least two age readers for any given stock, for redundancy}
\item{Generate an age-error matrices as part of your standard procedures}
\end{enumerate}

## Training

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Develop a document that details the steps to train new agers, and/or add it to your regional SOP}
\item{Establish procedures that integrate current practices (e.g. labels that have been used for many year) into improved practices}
\end{enumerate}

## Digital imaging of ageing structures

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Ensure that a scale bar is present in the image so that the image scale in pixels per mm can be determined}
\item{The file naming convention to use when taking images of ageing structures should uniquely identify each ageing structure, a recommended nomenclature would be as follows:}
\item{When practical, promote the capture of digital images of ageing structures}
\item{Digital images of ageing structures should be stored in enterprise-level infrastructure where proper backups are in place}
\item{A DFO-led app to store and retrieve digital images of ageing structures should be implemented to facilitate the management of these images and to provide integration with the SmartDots software}
\end{enumerate}

## Analysis of age estimates
\begin{enumerate}
\item{The sampling design used in the collection of data should be accounted for in all subsequent analyses of age estimates}
\item{Analyses that compute catch-at-age matrices from length samples and age estimates should strive to be fully documented and reproducible}
\item{Contemporary procedures that reduce bias in age structure estimates should be used}
\item{Assessment methods would ideally incorporate ageing errors into the assessment framework}
\end{enumerate}

## Preparing for changes associated with a warming climate
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Regularly revisit the pattern recognition used for estimating ages}
\item{Rate of growths are likely to change, so are the patterns associated with age estimation}
\item{Continued inter-regional communication and events that promote collaborations}
\item{Northward migration of species will shift stock boundaries and change the species that will require science advice}
\item{Establish a process so that “cheat sheets” and guides used for training agers, and the associated laboratory processes for age estimation are updated regularly}
\end{enumerate}

## Research and development
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Pursue further studies in sclerochronology that will support the identification of changes in patterns used in estimating ages}
\item{Investigate the trade-offs involved between taking images and annotate them versus just estimating a single age-length pair}
\end{enumerate}

These recommendations were formulated at the workshop and further revised by all authors. They represent procedures that should be followed by all DFO personnel involved in age estimations.
