# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

The purpose of the Technical Expertise in Stock Assessment (TESA) program is to promote stock assessment excellence through organizing national activities that contribute to the development of expertise in stock assessment across Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).

TESA was created in 2009, in response to a loss of stock assessment expertise in DFO owing to retirements. Each year, TESA organises three or four training courses and one or two topical workshops on stock assessment issues. TESA is a national program with one or two representatives in each region – for more details see the [GCpedia website](http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/DFO_Science_TESA_ETES) (only accessible from the DFO network).

This report provides a written record of the TESA workshop on "Best practices in age estimation" that was held in Moncton, NB, from January 31 to February 02 2023. The list of participants can be found in Table \@ref(tab:participants) and all resources related to the workshop were stored in a [git repository maintained by TESA](https://github.com/TESA-workshops/ageing-best-practices-2023).

## Motivations

The use of an age-based population model is often lauded as the “gold standard” in stock assessment. Age-based models are favored over simpler population models because of their ability to convey biological realism and to provide a more nuanced understanding of population dynamics, including the effects of fishing on harvested populations. As the name implies, an age-based model requires information about the age of individuals in the population, which provides scientists with a foundation for analyzing the demographics of a population as it evolves over time. Ageing information, in conjunction with other observations, can inform us on the growth of individuals, the age-at-maturation of individuals, the age structure of a population and on other vital factors necessary to understand variations in numbers and biomass.

All DFO regions collect structures from marine organisms that are used in estimating their age. The procedures associated with collecting, cataloguing, storing, and obtaining age estimates of samples vary from lab to lab. It is important to follow best practices when estimating age from hard structures and not all personnel are aware of these.

While the use of age-based models is common and the software available to implement such assessments are available and evolving, the manipulation of the input data that feeds into those models is often done in an ad-hoc fashion particular to the lab or agency in charge of the assessment. While these ad-hoc methods are most likely defensible and appropriate, the details that go into the computation of catch-at-age matrices are often poorly documented, making results hard to reproduce by someone outside a given lab or agency. This workshop provided an opportunity for DFO scientists using age-based assessments, and those involved in the analyses of age and length information, to share ideas and develop better methods to use ageing data in assessments.

## Objectives

The objectives of this workshop were to create a forum for discussion and for exchanging ideas among DFO scientists that use age-based models and that are involved in ageing activities. In particular, the workshop provided:

- guidance on ageing structures collection and on the sampling design for collecting ageing structures

- guidance on age determination using ageing structures, best practices for annuli validation, reference collections, ager calibration, archival of ageing structures and data warehousing 

- guidance on digital imaging of ageing structures

- guidance on going from length frequency samples and age-length keys to catch-at-age matrices that feed into age-based population models

## Format

A hybrid meeting was held from January 31 2023 to February 02 2023. The list of participants and the attendance can be found in Table \@ref(tab:participants). A total of 76 participants attended the event (30 in person and 46 virtually), including two external experts who joined the meeting virtually. The workshop was attended by a wide variety of DFO personnel ranging from research scientists, to biologists, to fisheries technicians and also included two students and a professor from a local university.
