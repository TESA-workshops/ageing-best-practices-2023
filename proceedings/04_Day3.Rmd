# Day 3 - Analysis of age estimates {#sec:day3}

The third day of the workshop focused on what is done with age estimates, namely the use of such data in fitting growth models and in computing catch-at-age matrices.

Growth models presentations by Daniel Ricard and Andrea Perreault. The importance of accounting for length-stratified sampling was emphasized since it can lead to biased estimates of growth model parameters [@Perreault-etal-2020-length-stratification].

Lisa Ailloud from NOAA NMFS gave a presentation about age-length keys. She discussed the distinction between forward and reverse age-length keys, and provided an alternative hybrid methodology that was previously applied to bluefin tuna [@Ailloud-Hoenig-2019-theory; @Ailloud-etal-2019-bluefin].  

Catch-at-age calculations presentation by Andrew Smith from the Quebec Region described his experience with trying to replicate catch-at-age calculations that were previously done in a bespoke software called *catch.exe*. An R package that was developed to compute catch-at-age matrices was also presented [@Ouellette-Plante-etal-2022-catchR].

Kim Emond from the Quebec Region presented the methodologies used in the herring stock assessment to compute catch-at-age matrices from commercial landings and from hydroacoustic surveys.

Christopher Corriveau and Ellie Weise from Dalhousie University presented their work on using DNA methylation to estimate ages. The presentation provided an overview of this new methodology.

A group discussion finally took place to draft the recommendations that appears in section \@ref(sec:recommendations). The recommendations cover a variety of subjects, ranging from practical recommendations for age estimation to institutional recommendations that could foster the development of a community of age readers within DFO.
