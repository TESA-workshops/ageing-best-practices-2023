# Day 3 - Analysis of age estimates {#sec:day3}

The third day of the workshop focused on what is done with age estimates, namely the use of such data in fitting growth models and in computing catch-at-age matrices.

Growth models presentations by Daniel Ricard and Andrea Perreault

Lisa Ailloud from NOAA NMFS gave a presentation about age-length keys.

Catch-at-age calculations presentation by Andrew Smith from the Quebec Region described his experience with trying to replicate catch-at-age calculations that were previously done in a bespoke software called *catch.exe*.

Kim Emond from the Quebec Region presented the methodologies used in the herring stock assessment to compute catch-at-age matrices from commercial landings and from hydroacoustic surveys.

Christopher Corriveau and Ellie Weise from Dalhousie University presented their work on using DNA methylation to estimate ages.

A group discussion finally took place to draft the recommendations that appears in section \@ref(sec:recommendations).
