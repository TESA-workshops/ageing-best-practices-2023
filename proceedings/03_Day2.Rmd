## Day 2 - Digital imaging of ageing structures {#sec:day2}

The second day of the workshop focused on topics related to the capture of digital images of ageing structures and how to annotate them.

The day started with a tour of the laboratory facilities used in age estimations at the Gulf Fisheries Centre. The laboratories used for age estimation of Atlantic Cod, American Plaice, Winter Flounder, Yellowtail Flounder and Atlantic Herring. The facilities used for imaging whole otoliths mounted in epoxy and imaging of whole otoliths were visited and participants had the opportunity to ask questions and try the tools and software used by their Gulf Region colleagues.

A presentation about *SmartDots* from external expert Julie Coad Davies showed how this tool is being used for otolith exchanges between laboratories in Europe. The development of the *SmartDots* application is managed by ICES Working Group on SmartDots Governance ([WGSMART](https://www.ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/WGSMART.aspx)) in close collaboration with the ICES Secretariat as well as national fisheries laboratories. 

Karen Robertson gave a presentation on taking good images of otoliths. She showed how it is important to have a reliable workspace with appropriate lighting and a microscope equipped with a digital camera. The image capture can be done in a number of software, including the one provided by the microscope manufacturer, the Leica LAS X software suite. Karen also pointed out the importance of having a well-defined naming convention for images and a strict protocol for file storage. Image processing is an important step to improve the readability of otolith images and a number of filtering options are available.

David Fishman presented options for developing a storage solution for otolith images. A discussion about DFO Dots followed. Participants felt that having access to a tool that helps in managing otolith collections and curating reference collections would be beneficial to their work.

A group discussion on the reporting features of *SmartDots* and how the tool can be used for obtaining growth increments followed.

Capturing digital images of ageing structures adds time to the laboratory process used to obtain age estimates. It is unclear whether the benefits of obtaining digital images of ageing structures outweighs the costs associated with the additional time required. As a starting point, a reference collection should be imaged. Having a reference collection of imaged otoliths allows you to document examples of what otoliths of a particular age-class look like and to explain why classification of being a different age would be incorrect. Reference collections are also useful for training new readers and for providing continuity in ageing methodologies when there are discontinuities in an aging program (e.g. times when there is no overlap between new and former readers).  

Once digital images of ageing structures are available, an additional step is to annotate them. It is probably impractical to annotate images in production ageing situations, but as a starting point the reference collection should be annotated in SmartDots. This provides an authoritative record that can be used to better document the reference collection.
