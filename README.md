# 2023 TESA best practices in ageing workshop

Note that the aim of the workshop is **not** to learn how to age a specific species of fish using otoliths. Rather, we aim to get all participants interested in performing ageing-related tasks in the most defensible and reproducible ways possible.

## Logistics

**When:** Tuesday January 31 to Thursday February 02 2023

**Where:** [Atlantic Science Enterprise Centre (ASEC)](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/organization/sec-ces/atlantic-atlantique/index-eng.html), [343 Université Ave., Moncton, NB.](https://goo.gl/maps/b8MkB6J9Ydot5snE9)

**Format:** Hybrid, in-person workshop with possibility to join via MS Teams

## Expected deliverables

Recommendations on what constitutes best practices for ageing procedures, otolith imaging and analyses that use age information.

Proceedings (Can. Tech. Rep.).

This GitHub repository to share presentations and other resources.

### Workshop dinner

For those interested, we will have a group dinner on Wednesday February 01 2023 at 6:30pm at the [Pump House](https://www.pumphousebrewpub.ca/).

## Travels

### Accommodation and parking

There are a number of hotel options in Moncton that offer government rates. These include the [Delta Beauséjour](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/yqmdr-delta-hotels-beausejour/overview/), the [Hilton Garden Inn and Canvas Moncton](https://www.hilton.com/en/locations/canada/new-brunswick/moncton/hilton-garden-inn/), and the [Hyatt Place Moncton](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/canada/hyatt-place-moncton-downtown/yqmzm).

The Atlantic Science Enterprise Centre is a large meeting facility located on the 5th floor of the Gulf Fisheries Centre (GFC), [located around 1500 meters from downtown Moncton](https://goo.gl/maps/b8MkB6J9Ydot5snE9).

For participants coming to Moncton by car, there is very limited visitor parking at the GFC and some all-day parking on nearby streets. As such, it would be preferable if participants could come to the ASEC by foot or by taxi, or park on nearby streets.

### Flights

Fly into the [Greater Moncton Roméo LeBlanc International Airport (YQM)](https://cyqm.ca/).

Taxi from the airport to downtown Moncton is about $25.
