# 2023 TESA best practices in ageing workshop
TESA workshop on best practices in ageing

## Logistics

**When:** Tuesday January 31 to Thursday February 02 2023

**Where:** [Atlantic Science Enterprise Centre (ASEC)](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/organization/sec-ces/atlantic-atlantique/index-eng.html), Moncton, NB.  

**Format:** In-person workshop with possibility to join via MS Teams

**Objectives:** 


**Accommodation and parking:** 
There are a number of hotel options in Moncton that offer government rates. These include the [Delta Beauséjour](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/yqmdr-delta-hotels-beausejour/overview/), the [Hilton Garden Inn and Canvas Moncton](https://www.hilton.com/en/locations/canada/new-brunswick/moncton/hilton-garden-inn/), and the [Hyatt Place Moncton](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/canada/hyatt-place-moncton-downtown/yqmzm).

The Atlantic Science Enterprise Centre is a large meeting facility located on the 5th floor of the Gulf Fisheries Centre (GFC), located around 1500 meters from downtown Moncton.

For participants coming to Moncton by car, there is very limited visitor parking at the GFC and some all-day parking on nearby streets. As such, it would be preferable if participants could come to the ASEC by foot or by taxi, or park on nearby streets.

**Flights**

Fly into Moncton airport (YQM).

Taxi from the airport to downtown Moncton is about $25.

## Target audience

Biologists whose mandate deals with species that are or were routinely aged, technicians in charge of ageing fish individuals using otoliths, stock assessment scientists who analyse ageing data to determine growth and to inform age-based population models.

The workshop is organised such that virtual participants are encouraged to attend the parts that best suit their interests and desires. 

## Workshop outline (still in evolution)

### Purpose
A workshop to review best practices in ageing marine organisms and how this information feeds into stock assessments. It is hoped that this event will allow DFO participants to share experiences and learn from each other in order to improve the reliability of their ageing activities.

### Chairs
[Daniel Ricard](mailto:Daniel.Ricard@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) (Gulf Fisheries Centre) & [Peter Comeau](mailto:Peter.Comeau@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) (Bedford Institute of Oceanography)

### Overview of topics to be covered

#### Basics of age determination (validation, calibration, archival, analyses)
Brief review of relevant litterature.

Presentation of the Gulf Region Standard Operating Procedures document.


#### Microscope digital photography of otoliths


#### Otolith image annotation (age determination, ager comparisons, growth increments)
Use of the [SmartDots software](https://smartdots.ices.dk/) for interacting with otolith images.

#### From lengths frequencies to catch-at-age matrices
How is ageing data used to compute catch-at-age matrices?

#### Growth models
How is ageing data used to estimate growth model parameters?

----

**Original motivation** The original idea behind this workshop was formulated back in 2021 during a TESA committee meeting where different workshop topics were being discussed.

Note that the aim of the workshop is **not** to learn how to age a specific species of fish using otoliths. Rather, we aim to get all participants interested in performing ageing-related tasks in the most defensible and reproducible ways.

## Workshop dinner

We will have a group dinner for those interested on Tuesday January 31 2023 at 6:30pm at the [Gusto Italian Grill & Bar](https://gustoitaliangrill.ca/menu/).

## Prerequisites

The only prerequiste is that participants' mandated tasks involve collection of ageing materials, age determination, or analysis of ageing data for stock assessments.

## Equipment and computer programs to be demonstrated

- otolith preparation and sectioning
- Leica S8i microscopes using Leica LAS X software
- SmartDots software for image annotation
- methods for fitting growth models in R
- methods for computing catch-at-age matrices in R
