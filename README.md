# 2023 TESA best practices in ageing workshop
TESA workshop on best practices in ageing

## Logistics

**When:** 3 days in March 2022 (tentative)

**Where:** [Atlantic Science Enterprise Centre](https://www.science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_98238.html), Moncton, NB.  

**Format:** In-person workshop with possibility to join via MS Teams

**Accommodation and parking:** 
There are a number of hotel options in Moncton that offer government rates. The Atlantic Science Enterprise Centre is a large meeting facility located on the 5th floor of the Gulf Fisheries Centre (GFC), located around 1500 meters from downtown Moncton.

For participants coming to Moncton by car, there is limited visitor parking at the GFC and in nearby streets. 

**Flights**

Fly into Moncton airport (YQM).

Taxi from the airport to downtown Moncton is about $25.

## Target audience

Biologists whose mandate deals with species that are or were routinely aged, technicians in charge of ageing fish individuals using otoliths, stock assessment scientists who analyse ageing data to determine growth and to inform age-based population models.

The workshop is organised such that virtual participants are encouraged to attend the parts that best suit their interests and desires. 

## Workshop outline (still in evolution)

### Purpose
A workshop to review best practices in ageing marine organisms and how this information feeds into stock assessments. It is hoped that this event will allow DFO participants to share experiences and learn from each other in order to improve the reliability of their ageing activities.

### Chairs
Daniel Ricard (GFC) & Peter Comeau (BIO)

### Overview of topics to be covered

#### Basics of age determination (validation, calibration, archival, analyses)

#### Microscope digital photography of otoliths

#### Otolith image annotation (age determination, ager comparisons, growth increments)

#### From lengths frequencies to catch-at-age matrices

### Tentative schedule (still subject to change as we get closer to the workshop)

**Other further ideas, keeping here for now**


**Original motivation** The original idea behind this workshop was formulated back in 2021 during a TESA committee meeting where different workshop topics were being discussed.

Note that the aim of the workshop is **not** to learn how to age a specific species of fish using otoliths. Rather, we aim to get all participants interested in performing ageing-related tasks in the most defensible and reproducible ways.


## Workshop dinner

We will have a group dinner for those interested on Wednesday 6:30pm at the [Gusto Italian Grill & Bar](https://gustoitaliangrill.ca/menu/).

## Prerequisites

The only prerequiste is that participants' mandated tasks involve collection of ageing materials, age determination, or analysis of ageing data for stock assessments.


## Equipment and computer programs to be demonstrated


## Products

Proceedings (Can. Tech. Rep.), which can hopefully be collaboratively written during the workshop.

GitHub repositories to share presentations and other resources.

### Participants

(From TESA's spreadsheet, continually being updated as necessary).
