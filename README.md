# 2023 TESA best practices in ageing workshop

Note that the aim of the workshop is **not** to learn how to age a specific species of fish using otoliths. Rather, we aim to get all participants interested in performing ageing-related tasks in the most defensible and reproducible ways possible.

## Travels

### Accommodation and parking

There are a number of hotel options in Moncton that offer government rates. These include the [Delta Beauséjour](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/yqmdr-delta-hotels-beausejour/overview/), the [Hilton Garden Inn and Canvas Moncton](https://www.hilton.com/en/locations/canada/new-brunswick/moncton/hilton-garden-inn/), and the [Hyatt Place Moncton](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/canada/hyatt-place-moncton-downtown/yqmzm).

The Atlantic Science Enterprise Centre is a large meeting facility located on the 5th floor of the Gulf Fisheries Centre (GFC), [located around 1500 meters from downtown Moncton](https://goo.gl/maps/b8MkB6J9Ydot5snE9).

For participants coming to Moncton by car, there is very limited visitor parking at the GFC and some all-day parking on nearby streets. As such, it would be preferable if participants could come to the ASEC by foot or by taxi, or park on nearby streets.

### Flights

Fly into the [Greater Moncton Roméo LeBlanc International Airport (YQM)](https://cyqm.ca/).

Taxi from the airport to downtown Moncton is about $25.
