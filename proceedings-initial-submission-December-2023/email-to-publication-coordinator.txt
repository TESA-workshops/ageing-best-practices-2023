Dear Dr. Clements,
We are pleased to submit a report titled "Proceedings of the Technical Expertise in Stock Assessment (TESA) national workshop on Best pratices in age estimation, 31 January, 01-02 February 2023 in Moncton, New Brunswick" for publication as a Technical Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences.

This report is the proceedings document of a workshop that was held in Moncton earlier this year. We hope that the recommendations made in this report will guide senior managers in making decisions about allocation of resources to scientific programs and highlights the scope and importance work done on age estimaion across DFO regions. 

A report submission form with the report title and full list of authors is also attached. All authors have participated in the development of this report and have agreed to send the report for review.

We have the following suggested reviewers for this proceedings document:
1 - Stephanie Sardelis (DFO NCR, involved in TESA)
2 - Dr. Robyn Forrest (DFO Pacific, chair of TESA)
3 - Dr. Daniel Duplisea (DFO Qu√©bec, former chair of TESA)

We look forward to hearing from you about this submission.

All the best.


Daniel Ricard and co-authors
