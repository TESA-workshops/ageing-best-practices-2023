## Obtaining ageing structures



## Preparation

- Epoxy

- Saws, noise and dust


## Storage

- Ideal situation

- Reality


## Inventory

- OpenData and FGP datasets as a starting point
- Write a metadata record for each "otolith collection"
- The dataset shared in the public domain is the summary of physical otoliths in the collection
- By also adding the number of otoliths that have been aged, the "git diff" on the OpenData dataset represents a progress report of sort
