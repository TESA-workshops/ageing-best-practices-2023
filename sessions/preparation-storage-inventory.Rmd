## Standard operating procedures

\begin{center}

\end{center}


## Obtaining ageing structures

- Samples from commercial landings
  - Port sampling
  - At-sea observers
- Samples from research surveys
  - Length stratified sampling
  - Sex and length stratified sampling
- Other sampling opportunities
  - Trapnet
  - Recreational fisheries
  - ...

## Cataloguing

- Procedures to identify the otoliths that are collected
- Maintain the unique identity of each otolith through the documentation of its source, date collected, fish species, fish length, ...
- Ideally, storage of information in a database, but a well-curated spreadsheet or collection of ASCII files can work too

## Preparation

- Cleaning
- Polishing
- Mounting in epoxy resin
  - Clear resin
  - Opaque resin
- Mounting on wax
- Mounting on microscope slide
- Crack and burn
- Sectioning
  - Saws, noise and dust
- Imaging (more on that tomorrow)

## Storage

\begin{columns}
\column{0.6\textwidth}

- Ideal situation
  - Central quality-controlled environment with archival level documentation of physical samples 
  - No deterioration of physical otoliths
  - Maintain the readability of otoliths

- Reality
  - Hapzard collections of different ageing structures located in a number of places, and with varying levels of documentation
  - Storage in glycerin that deteriorates otoliths in the longer term

## Inventory of otolith collections

- OpenData and FGP datasets as a starting point
- write a metadata record for each "otolith collection"
- the dataset shared in the public domain is the summary of physical otoliths in the collection
- by also adding the number of otoliths that have been aged, the "git diff" on the OpenData dataset represents a [progress report of sort](https://github.com/dfo-gulf-science/fgp-datasets/commit/a7683278f9eba33c5a55f0fd8b092cb7867de21e)
