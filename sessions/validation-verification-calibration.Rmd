## Age validation

- The review by @Campana-2001-review is a must-read for anyone involved in age determination activities

- A necessary step to establish the existence and the frequency of opaque and translucent zones

## Otolith reference collection

- Series of otoliths of known ages used to determine whether an ager provides accurate and unbiased ages

- Physical collection

- Digital images of physical collection

- An important step to allow for ager calibration

## Ager calibration

- American Plaice and White Hake examples
  - R Markdown document that performs a calibration run, where the assigned ages are compared to the "true" ages in the reference collection

- Otolith exchange with other labs


## Age verification

- Recent example for American Plaice and Winter Flounder
- R Markdown document that provides the information required to verify and validate the assigned ages 
- Outliers are identified and flagged
  - What constitutes an outlier?
- The first step is for the ager to go and re-age these otoliths
- The second step is to ascertain that the identified outliers are aged with certainty
- The ages are now ready to be included in the production database, in our case in the bio cards
