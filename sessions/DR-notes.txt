I would like to recognize that I am participating today from traditional Mi'Kmaq territory in what is known

## Fitting a VB growth model with sex-specific and decadal parameter values



## Alternatively, implement as a Bayesian model in JAGS


## Alternatively, implement in TMB


## Individual growth trajectories



## Fitting a mixed effects VB model to growth trajetories


## Using length frequencies to estimate growth

What if no ageing is available? What if we could use length frequencies to track cohorts and estimate their growth?


## Other growth models

- Gompertz model
