## SmartDots reporting

- SmartDots provides two options for reporting : a report and a dataset 

## Growth increments

- The coordinates of annotation can be used to compute the distance between points

## Biological intercept

- The article by @Campana-1998-backcalculations provides the background to compute a biological intercept

## Growth trajectories

- We now have an age-length pair for each year in the life of the fish individual from which the otolith was removed
